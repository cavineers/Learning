# Learning

Welcome to the website that houses the learning material that we use to teach rookies on our robotics team! For years to come, we have created this website to be continously maintained and used for teaching rookies. For starters, here is some information about the structure of our team. Our team is divided into three branches: software, hardware, and mechanical.
## Resources

| Software | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [Rev Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/gs/install) | The client we use when setting CANIds for our motors and to monitor the Can Bus (information wire) that connects our motor controllers and several other components.
| [FRC Game tools](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html#479842) | A software bundle that includes the FRC Driver Station and FRC Utilities. These components are required for FRC teams to configure and control robots and communicate with the field.
| [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases) | A library that contains all the code that we use to program our robot. It is a library that is built on top of Java and is used to program the robot. It is also used to program the robot's autonomous mode.
| [FRC Radio Imager](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html) | A tool that is used to configure the radio that is used to connect the robot to the driver station. It is used to configure the radio to connect to the robot's radio.

| [Imaging the roboRIO2](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/roborio2-imaging.html) | A guide that shows how to image the roboRIO2. The roboRIO2 is the main computer that is used to control the robot. It is the brain of the robot.

## [Software](Software/Java/index.md)

The software subteam holds  for writing the code that runs our robots. They use the programming language Java to program our robots. The software subteam is responsible for:

- Programming the robot
- Testing the robot
- Creating a Scouting app for competition
- Strategizing for autonomous

## [Hardware](Hardware/index.md)

Hardware is responsible for wiring components and placing them on the robots. They use tools such as CAD (computer-aided design) software and 3D printers to create mounts and holders for components. Some of the hardware components they work with include:

- 12V Battery
- Motors
- Sensors
- Microcontrollers (such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi)

## [Mechanical](Mechanical/index.md)

The mechanical subteam is responsible for making the physical robot. Their responsibilities include:

- Examining the specific years challenge to effectively solve the problem presented with a machine
- Fully CADing the assembled robot
- Building each subsystem and chassis of the robot
