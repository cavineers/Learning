# Learning

Welcome to the website that houses the learning material that we use to teach rookies on our robotics team! For years to come, we have created this website to be continously maintained and used for teaching rookies. For starters, here is some information about the structure of our team. Our team is divided into three branches: software, hardware, and mechanical.

## [Software](Software/Java/index.md)

The software subteam holds  for writing the code that runs our robots. They use the programming language Java to program our robots. The software subteam is responsible for:

- Programming the robot
- Testing the robot
- Creating a Scouting app for competition
- Strategizing for autonomous

## Hardware

Hardware is responsible for wiring components and placing them on the robots. They use tools such as CAD (computer-aided design) software and 3D printers to create mounts and holders for components. Some of the hardware components they work with include:

- 12V Battery
- Motors
- Sensors
- Microcontrollers (such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi)

## Mechanical

The mechanical subteam is responsible for making the physical robot. Their responsibilities include:

- Examining the specific years challenge to effectively solve the problem presented with a machine
- Fully CADing the assembled robot
- Building each subsystem and chassis of the robot
