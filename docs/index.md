# Learning

Welcome to the website that houses the learning material that we use to teach rookies on our robotics team! For years to come, we have created this website to be continously maintained and used for teaching rookies. For now, this website is primarily being used by controls for documentation and teaching purposes.

<!-- ## [Software](Software/Java/index.md)

The software subteam holds the responsibility for writing the code that runs our robots. They use the programming language Java to program our robots. The software subteam is responsible for:

- Programming the robot
- Testing the robot
- Creating a Scouting app for competition
- Strategizing for autonomous

## [Hardware](Hardware/index.md)

Hardware is responsible for wiring components and placing them on the robots. They use tools such as CAD (computer-aided design) software and 3D printers to create mounts and holders for components. 

## [Mechanical](Mechanical/index.md)

The mechanical subteam constructs the physical robot. Their responsibilities include:

- Examining the specific years challenge to effectively solve the problem presented with a machine
- Fully CADing the assembled robot
- Building each subsystem and chassis of the robot -->
