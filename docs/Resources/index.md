# Resources
This page contains a list of resources that are used to control, program, and maintain the robot. This includes software, documentation, and other resources.

## General Documentation
| Documentation | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [Hardware Component Overview](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html) | A guide which provides a brief overview of the hardware components that make up the FRC Control System. Each component will contain a brief description of the component function and a link to more documentation. This link includes a wiring diagram and descriptions of our main components.
| [Imaging the roboRIO2](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/roborio2-imaging.html) | A guide that shows how to image the roboRIO2. The roboRIO2 is the main computer that is used to control the robot. It is the brain of the robot.
| [Imaging the roboRIO](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/imaging-your-roborio.html) | A guide that shows how to image the roboRIO. The roboRIO is the main computer that is used to control the robot. It is the brain of the robot.
| [SPARK MAX LED Patterns](https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/status-led) | A guide that shows the different LED patterns that the SPARK MAX motor controller can display. The SPARK MAX controls all of the motors on our newer robots.
## Hardware
| Software | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Rev Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/gs/install) | The client we use when setting CANIds for our motors and to monitor the Can Bus (information wire) that connects our motor controllers and several other components.
| [FRC Game tools](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html#479842) | A software bundle that includes the FRC Driver Station and FRC Utilities. These components are required for FRC teams to configure and control robots and communicate with the field.
| [FRC Radio Imager](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html) | A tool that is used to configure the radio that is used to connect the robot to the driver station. 
| [Phoenix Tuner X](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NVV4PWDW27Z?hl=en-us&gl=US) | A tool that is used to configure the Phoenix brand motor controllers and other components. This app is not supported for Mac OS.

## Programming
| Software | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases) | A library that contains all the code that we use to program our robot. It is a library that is built on top of Java and is used to program the robot. It is also used to program the robot's autonomous mode.
| [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) | A tool that is used to manage the code that is used to program the robot. 
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | Integrated development environment (IDE) that is used to write the code that is used to control the robot.
