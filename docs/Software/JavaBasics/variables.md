## Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store values in Java. Here's how you can declare and initialize a variable:

```java
int myNumber = 42;
```

In this example, `myNumber` is a variable of type `int` that is initialized with the value `42`. Java has several different data types, including:

- `int`: used for storing integers (whole numbers).
- `double`: used for storing floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).
- `boolean`: used for storing `true` or `false` values.
