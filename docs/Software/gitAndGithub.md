# Git and GitHub

As a Rookie on Software, you've probably hear the terms Git and GitHub thrown around quite a bit. These two terms are often used interchangeably but they are not the same thing. Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes made to your code over time. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and allows for collaboration on code projects. In this article, we'll explore Git and GitHub and how they work together.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to your code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, in 2005. Git is used by millions of developers worldwide to manage their codebases.

### How does Git work?

Git works by keeping a record of changes made to your code over time. These changes are stored in a repository, which is like a database of your code's history. When you make changes to your code, Git records those changes and creates a new version of your code. You can then compare different versions of your code and revert to an earlier version if necessary.

    - **Repository:** A repository is a collection of files and folders that make up your codebase. It contains all the versions of your code.
    - **Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. It records the changes made to your code since the last commit.
    - **Branch:** A branch is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on different versions of your code without affecting the main version.
    - **Merge:** Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. It allows you to bring changes from a separate line of development into the main version of your code.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It was founded in 2008 and is now owned by Microsoft. GitHub is used by millions of developers worldwide to collaborate on code projects.

### How does GitHub work?

GitHub works by providing a web-based interface for Git repositories. You can create a repository on GitHub and then clone it to your local machine using Git. You can then make changes to your code and push those changes back to GitHub. Other developers can then clone your repository and make their own changes.

    - **Fork:** A fork is a copy of a repository. It allows you to make changes to someone else's code without affecting the original codebase.
    - **Pull Request:** A pull request is a way to suggest changes to someone else's code. You can submit a pull request to a repository owner, who can then review your changes and merge them into the main codebase.
    - **Issues:** Issues are a way to track bugs or feature requests for a repository. You can create an issue and assign it to a developer, who can then work on fixing the bug or implementing the feature.
