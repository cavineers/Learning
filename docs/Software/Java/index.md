# Java

Java is a popular and versatile programming language that is used to create a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise-level software systems. Our robot is programmed in 100% Java, so you'll need to become even more familiar with the language.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can start coding in Java, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the basic steps:

1. Download and install the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows) from the official website.
2. Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), for programming the bot, we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Hello World

The "Hello World" program is a classic example used to introduce beginners to programming languages. Create a new file in Vscode named `Main.java` and then paste this program into the file.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Run the program by clicking the the play button on the top right of your screen, it should output "Hello, World!" to the console. Try it!
