# Java

Java is a popular and versatile programming language that is used to create a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise-level software systems. Our robot is programmed in 100% Java, so you'll need to become even more familiar with the language.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can start coding in Java, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the basic steps:

1. Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official website.
2. Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), for programming the bot, we use Visual Studio Code, aka Vscode.
3. Create a new project in Vscode and start coding.
