# Methods

Methods are used to define the behavior of a class. Here's an example of a method in the `Person` class:

```java
public void sayHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
}
```

In this example, we have defined a method called `sayHello()`. The method uses the `name` and `age` instance variables to print a message to the console.
