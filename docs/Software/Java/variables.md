## Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store values in Java. Here's how you can declare and initialize a variable:

```java
int myNumber = 42;
double myLongNumber = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679;
boolean myBoolean = true;
```

In this example, `myNumber` is a variable of type `int` that is initialized with the value `42`. Java has several different data types, including:

- `int`: used for storing integers (whole numbers).
- `double`: used for storing floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).
- `boolean`: used for storing `true` or `false` values.
